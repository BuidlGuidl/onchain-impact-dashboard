It has amassed a total TVL of about $100M across networks, and has been live since 2020. \n\nThe protocol facilitates  non-custodial management of assets between individuals seeking to allocate funds and vault managers with an onchain track record of performance. These vault managers have special privileges including trading assets on depositors behalf, using whitelisted protocols, collecting management fees, and making updates to the tradable assets of vaults. In addition, users can utilize automatic yield and leveraged vaults.\n\nThrough these vaults, structured products can be created using automation, such as mStable and Toros Finance. Some of the successful products include: derivative, yield, and index vaults.\n\n653 vaults are deployed across Optimism and Base by the dHEDGE factory contracts.",

      "description": "Minibridge is a \"zero-fee\" cross-chain tool that offers multi-chain support for BTC/EVM/non-EVM and features such as fast transactions. It was developed by the Chaineye team specifically for users' small-amount transfer scenarios. Launched for less than half a year, Minibridge has already processed 300K transactions and served 100K Web3 users. In user ratings on dappsheriff.com, Minibridge ranks first among all cross-chain bridge projects and was awarded \"Best Tool of the Year\" in the \"PARTY AWARD 2024\" annual selection by PA News.\n\nKey Features\n\nChaineye was born from the Web3 community and we build products for the community’s needs. To better serve the community, Chaineye has built many free tools such as Onchain Map, CEX Transfer Fees, Multichain Gas, RPC List, etc. The Mini Bridge was designed specifically for retail investors with small-amount cross-chain transfer requests, including the following features:\n\nZero bridge fees: We don’t charge any bridge fees at all. This means users will get the same amount of assets on the destination chains. We are built for retail investors and we believe our community like free services. Only a minimum gas fee on the destination chain is charged.\n\nFastest transactions: Our bridge has the fastest bridging experience across all existing bridges. The bridging time largely depends on the confirmation time of source and destination blockchains. We don’t want our users to wait any longer than the evitable blockchain transaction time.\n\nDesigned especially for small-amount transfer scenarios such as gas refill, airdrop claiming, moving funds, etc. It helps to save huge money and time for individual investors when doing so.\n\nGas swap: Our community wants to use the destination chain directly after bridging. We get it! The gas swap feature allows users to swap a small amount of source chain ETH to the destination chain native gas token. It is very useful for those chains where ETH is not the native gas token such as BNB Chain, Polygon, ZetaChain, ZkFair, Avalanche, Map, Mantle, and Metis.\n\nFast Integration: Our team is monitoring the market closely and is ready to integrate the latest blockchains in time. Chaineye Mini Bridge currently supports a total of 24 networks including the latest Blast EVM L2 and Merlin BTC L2 blockchain.\n\nOpen API: We have opened the API docs on our documentation site. Any individuals or third parties can go through the API and seamlessly integrate Mini Bridge into their application. Chaineye Mini Bridge works in the same style for both requests from our front-end UI and API endpoints.\n\nSecurity: To prevent the potential security concern of smart contracts, we have implemented our bridge in a hybrid style - a combination of EOA and smart contracts. EOA for cross-chain transfers and smart contracts for cross-chain gas swaps. It helps to reduce the possibility of contract exploitation. In addition, we have our entire system audited and scrutinized by our security partners.\n\nRewards and Earn: Our users can enjoy a big bridge discount by participating in our various marketing campaigns. In addition, they can also earn referral rewards in ETH and $pMNB whenever their referred address makes a transfer. Everything is transparent and Chaineye Mini Bridge is built for the community.\n\nValue Proposition\nMiniBridge extends its liquidity aggregation services to all major OP stacks, including Optimism, Base, Zora, Mode, Fraxtal, and Redstone, enabling community users on all other chains to interact with the OP ecosystem. We are aiming to foster collaboration and engagement between our respective communities, helping OP and Chaineye users to transfer their assets freely across any supported blockchains with the lowest fees and the highest speed. \nMiniBridge was born from the community and built for the community. Our web3 community BitEye having over 300K active users is the largest Asian crypto community. MiniBridge will help bring BitEye to OP ecosystem with many highlights and marketing resources which will help both sides to grow into the next level. \nMiniBridge address on most blockchains is an EOA: 0x00000000000007736e2F9aA5630B8c812E1F3fc9. Since the birth of MiniBridge (roughly 6 months ago), it has made cumulatively 338,031 bridging transactions on all chains and 28,705 bridging transactions on Optimism and all supported OP stack blockchains. \n\nProject Resource\n\nWebsite: https://minibridge.chaineye.tools/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Chaineye_tools\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/chaineye\n\nGithub: https://github.com/DeFiEye\n\nDocumentation: https://docs.chaineye.tools/\n",

The competition is fierce! \n\nIt’s hard enough to get exposure to a targeted audience interested in learning about a new blockchain network and its Dapps. It’s even harder to convert them into users when there is more friction than incentives in the onboarding process. Even worse, hundreds of networks are launching every year making it even more challenging to attract and retain new users.\nUnitap aims to change this. \n\nIn Unitap anyone will be able to learn about Web3 from zero, find new networks and dapps, learn how to use them with how-to-do videos, get free gas drips to get started, and do missions to get rewarded for using new products, ALL IN ONE PLACE. Additionally, Unitap is Sybil-resistant therefore all new users will be unique and the incentives won’t be drained by bots or bad actors. \n\nMost future web3 users have not been onboarded yet, these users will come through the path of least resistance and more incentives. Unitap is optimizing for offering both.\n\nUnitap has deployed Gas Tap, Token Tap, and Prize Tap on Optimism.\n\nGas Tap: Unique humans can obtain tiny amounts of gas tokens to get started on Optimism. X claims.\n\nToken Tap: Anyone can distribute any kind of tokens gated by the requirements they wish. Unitap distributed OP as incentives to anyone who claimed from the Gas Tap as a PoC and Glo Dollar distributed 500 USDGLO on Optimism using Token Tap.\n\nPrize Tap: Anyone can create raffles and gate them with the requirements they want. Glo Dollar used the Prize Tap contract in Optimism to distribute three 100 USDGLO prizes to users that sent at least 0.1 USDGLO to friends in Optimism.\n",

      "description": "Our team, a dedicated group of Web3 enthusiasts, embarked on our journey into the NFT space driven by our passion for the technology. However, the high cost of early NFTs was a significant barrier to widespread adoption. Discovering Optimistic Layer 2 (OP L2) was a game-changer for us. It enabled us to issue affordable NFTs at a fraction of the cost, opening the door for a broader audience.\n\nThis strategic pivot to L2 was met with remarkable success. We have issued millions of NFTs, democratizing access to digital assets. Our most popular NFT boasts over 100,000 holders, a testament to our approach of making NFTs accessible and valuable across multiple blockchains.\n\nOur vision is to continue this trajectory, enhancing the utility and engagement of our NFTs. We are committed to innovating and expanding the functionalities of our NFTs, ensuring they offer more than just ownership—creating new ways for holders to interact with and benefit from their digital assets.",

      "description": "Superfluid is the leading asset streaming protocol that brings subscriptions, salaries, vesting, and rewards distributions to DAOs and crypto-native businesses worldwide.\n\nThe protocol has been live on Optimism since March 2022 and on Base since July 2023. It has been empowering developers with a crypto-native financial primitive, money streaming, and a modular smart contracts framework to build applications that leverage a formula-based balance and gasless, liquid, ongoing value transfer.\n\nTo date 31,769 streams have been started on Optimism and 577,985 on Base for a combined total volume of over $170M.\n\nSuperfluid is designed to minimize its TVL in favor of making assets available to sender or recipient at all times, minimizing funds locked in smart contracts. As such its impact is better measures in total volume transferred, number of total or active streams, total number of users and daily active users. When measuring the protocol activity it's important to not only rely on the on-chain transaction to smart contracts, but also on the the inner mechanics of the protocol (i.e. by evaluating the actions triggered via callData or by using the protocol subgraph).\n\nOn the alignment with Optimism and Retro Funding Round 4\n- Superfluid is builder-centric. A developer tool with clear focus on onboarding more developers to build more apps. As such, it’s additive to Optimism’s own goals.\n- Superfluid is supporting long term, real world use cases, like Salaries, Subscriptions, Memberships, Rentals, Airdrops, Grants distribution as well as entirely novel applications in DeFi, SocialFi and beyond.\n\nSuperfluid Protocol has been used by the Optimism Foundation to stream the RPGF3 grants, and will be used again in the upcoming RPGF4 round, providing the rails for a seamless funds distribution.\n\nThe protocol has been designed around builders and developers, with a set of tools available for building, debugging and data retrieval that empower new applications development. Here you can see an overview of projects built on Superfluid that have added value (and usage) to the Optimism and Base networks: https://www.superfluid.finance/post/how-superfluid-protocol-is-empowering-onchain-builders\n\nIf you have any questions or would like to learn more about Superfluid, please reach out to mdali.eth on Warpcast or Twitter/X.",

Our custom contract is compatible on the Superchain with Optimism, Base, and Zora Network, boasting over 10,000 transactions across these networks. With a transaction volume exceeding $50,000 on paid mints, our platform empowers creators to sell and showcase digi-physical product drops seamlessly. By leveraging the CrowdmuseProduct Contract and Crowdmuse Merch Frame on Farcaster, creators retain full sovereignty over assets and funds, providing a user-centric approach to web3 adoption. \n\nThrough our partnerships across the Superchain, including Optimism and Base, we aim to drive consumer adoption and showcase the potential of Optimism as a consumer brand, targeting communities beyond the web3 space.\n\nWe are onboarding creators, brands and manufacturers onchain with our smart contract and ecommerce infra for a seamless payment and checkout experience. Creators and brands can utilize the CrowdmuseProduct Contract to sell products directly from their wallets or create a wallet using our Privy wallet abstraction plugin. This setup ensures complete control over assets and enables permissionless fund distribution.  \n\nBy building out a consumer crypto use case that regular people can enjoy, we are incentivizing long-term user adoption, especially as creators see new revenue opportunities through sustainable business models onchain. \n\nWith our track record of product drops on Base, Optimism and Zora Network, we aim to demonstrate the potential of the Superchain to scale. Our goal is to drive end-user adoption of Optimism by introducing innovative consumer experiences tailored to communities beyond web3.\n\nWe’re building an ecosystem which is transparent by design, giving consumers the information to shape commerce. This is especially important in consumer goods like fashion, where a lack of traceability has enabled extractive business models to thrive without accountability.",

      "description": "Tarot is a decentralized lending protocol where users can participate as lenders or borrowers in isolated lending pools. Lenders can supply tokens to earn single-sided passive yield without impermanent loss, while borrowers can leverage their LP tokens as collateral to borrow tokens supplied by lenders. Tarot is also a popular LP auto-compounder with some of the lowest reinvest fees in all of DeFi.\n\nWith a complete suite of liquidity solutions and yield opportunities, Tarot encourages liquidity provision on DEXs, particularly for long-tail assets, by offering traditional LP auto-compounding and transferring risk and reward among lenders and borrowers.",

When a transfer is initiated, the amount and recipient is never disclosed or published. Transactions are routed through a relayer, abstracting gas fees while providing an efficient transfer environment.  \n\nzkBob integrates compliance features such as deposit limits and optional KYC to offer secure and private transactions while preventing illicit activities. \n\nDevelopment is underway to support a decentralized relayer infrastructure including upgrading scripts for contracts (currently in progress), deploying a release with new accounting features to the Op USDC Pool, deploying a release with a decentralized relayer to the Op USDC Pool and deployment of additional provers/relayers.\n\n- For more information on compliance and zkBob, please see https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4787693.\n\n- For additional info on mechanics and usage, please see https://docs.zkbob.com/\n\n- Usage on Optimism can be seen here: https://dune.com/zkbob/zkbob-on-optimism",

      "description": "Keng Lernitas is a meme project that has been called the “biggest meme on Optimism” upon its creation. It began as an experiment by Kain Warwick to test the new gas costs after the implementation of EIP-4844. Consequently, a curated degen ecosystem, featuring $2192/$ZORKSEES, was born.\n\nNow, to explain what we do, let’s explore our brief history. Last March, Kain airdropped $2192 on Optimism to SNX stakers and asked the brand new holders to burn 90% of their tokens to be “spared” from the oubliettes. This initiated the first alignment test. The newly formed team behind the meme project, including Kain and his brother Grant Warwick, recognized the faithful and rewarded them with airdropped $ZORKSEES tokens on Base. For the next challenge, Keng Lernitas and Zorksees were compelled to “batel.” The team challenged the community to bridge tokens from Solana to Base using Wormhole, and once again, sacrifice tokens by transferring them into a \"batel\" wallet. The side that achieved the highest TVL would win. In total, more than 40% of the combined supply of $2192/$ZORKSEES has already been burned or sent to \"batel\" for the promise of glory (https://dune.com/nice2win/lernitas2192).\n\nIn summary, we are an event-driven meme project striving to create value for our community and allies. The newly established governance, called Keng Lernitas Ekosistem, is asking for a grant to continue building on our gamification culture by hosting more games and events. Throughout our journey, we have made fierce allies from the Synthetix and Infinex communities. Now, it is only natural to seek an alliance with the mighty Optimism Superchain!\n\nSome facts:\n\n-Around $250,000 USD of LP/bribes/incentives on Velodrome/Aerodrome was spent by Kain Warwick for experimental purposes\n-35.5% of $2192 supply has been burned\n-27% of $ZORKSEES supply and 8% of $2192 supply was sent to \"batel\" wallet\n-60k $2192 holders\n-6k $ZORKSEES holders on EVM\n\nSource: https://dune.com/nice2win/lernitas2192 / https://dune.com/nice2win/zorksees",

      "description": "GM - We're building Avantis, a fully onchain, generalized leverage trading exchange for synthetic crypto and real assets, built on and backed by Base. Avantis allows traders to long / short all kinds of assets with leverage, while retaining full custody of their funds. The capital for this comes from onchain LPs who passively market-make all trading activity. All trades and liquidity provisioning happens in USDC. \n\nSince our launch on Base in February this year, here's what we've achieved:\n\n1. 8,400 traders\n2. 96,000 trades \n3. Organic yield paid to LPs: $550,000 \n4. Total Trading Volume: $550M (10%+ coming from real world assets like forex and metals!). \n5. TVL: $7.5M (capped)\n\nNote: all protocol stats can be verified onchain as well as at: avantisfi.com/analytics\nToday, we’re looking to apply to RPGF to revolutionize the derivatives market. While there are several off-chain or hybrid exchanges available, we firmly believe in constructing a completely on-chain future through a permissionless platform for both RWAs and crypto assets, fueled by LPs and traders. We’re exclusive to the Superchain, committed to building a sustainable exchange long-term, and are just getting started.\n\nIn a matter of 3 short months, we've established ourselves as one of the leading destinations for Superchain (and specifically Base network) perp traders and LPs. We plan to keep going deeper into the Base stack, having already integrated Coinbase Pay to onramp users seamlessly, and are in the process of integrating CB smart wallets. We have three simple goals: \n\n1) RWA Adoption: Get more real world asset traders onchain (the onchain market currently lacks this diversity of traders. We believe we can onboard them effectively.)\n2) Superchain as a Derivatives Hub: Make Base (and the Superchain) the premier destination for onchain perpetuals trading and market-making. \n3) Democratize market-making: Provide competitive and safe yields for USDC LPs on Base, while giving them custom risk management tools. That is, we want to allow passive LPs the opportunity to market-make complex derivatives the same way institutions do, which is the true and original promise of DeFi. \n\n\n\n\n",

So we are surfing on new standards, propelled by different means, such as gamification and storytelling, to establish a community that will last over time and build a regular and active user base, notably thanks to the release of other mini-games seemlessly integrated our base runners ecosystem.

      "description": "What is LogX?\n\nTL;DR:\n\n- LogX is like 1inch for perps - helping on-chain traders find the best execution for their perp trades\n- LogX is also the leading Perp DEX on layer 2 networks including Mode Network and Optimism Main-Net. LogX pioneered and launched our own native perps on L2s like Mode Network with an innovative “Discrete Asset, Market Neutral” (DAMN) AMM pools. These pools take in stable assets like USDT, USDC, wUSDM, etc. and enable oracle-based perp trading to traders.\n- Backed by reputed investors like Sequoia Capital (India), Coinbase Ventures, IOSG, Hashed and more!\n- Crossed $15B in trading volume with more than 155k wallets in 9 months of operation.\n\nSince our inception, LogX’s mission has been to make the experience of trading on-chain bigger and better than CeFi, and through that onboard CEX users to DEXes. In fact this mission has remained unaltered ever since we wrote about it in our introduction blog in 2023 here: https://flintlabs.medium.com/flint-labs-next-chapter-7e56a87f4f5e\n\nIn our 9 months of operation, we have boldly explored various offerings for different trader segments. We identified two primary trader segments: pro traders desiring orderbook functionality and tools, and those seeking a simpler UX for multi-chain exploration. So we built LogX Pro for the former and LogX OG for the latter.\n\nLogX Pro is an Orderbook based Perp Dex which is live on Optimism Main-net, Arbitrum  and Base Network.\n\nLogX OG is a Perp DEX which is based on our own AMM pools.\n\n**Our Competitive Edge and Uniqueness:**\n\n- Low-Cost, High Liquidity Offering: LogX offers unmatched cost efficiency and high liquidity across multiple trading pairs, setting a new benchmark in the decentralized trading space.\n- Technological Superiority: Our innovative DAMN based AMM pool enables us to launch a perpetual dex on newer networks and ecosystems like Mode network at a speed unheard of. We were the first perp dex to deploy on Mode Network and bootstrapped liquidity to more than $3M in TVL and $1.3B in trading volume\n\n**Growth**\n\nLogX has been one of the fastest growing Perp DEXes on layer 2 networks. We were also the first perp dex to deploy on Mode Network in the first week of Main-net launch and are still the largest perp dex on Mode Network. We were the preferred strategic launch partner for Mode Network. \n\nSharing some metrics for LogX’s performance on the Mode Network.\n\n- TVL: $3M\n- Unique wallet addresses (lifetime): 30,000\n- Total trading volume lifetime(March-May): $1.3B\n- Avg DAU(last 30 days): 250\n\nLogX is also deployed on Optimism Main-net through their LogX Pro product which is an Orderbook based Perp Dex powered by the Orderly Network and has crossed $12B in trading volume with more than 30,000 wallets on the Optimism and Arbitrum Network combined.\n\nLogX’s overall performance across all the deployed L2s can be found here: https://app.logx.trade/dashboard\n\nThe whole premise of LogX is based built upon composability. LogX does not only integrate with other composable protocols, but other protocols can also integrate LogX. Applications like wallets, copy trading platforms, analytics platforms, etc. can find seamless composability with LogX.\n\nThis is important to us because LogX would not have existed if not for the composability of other protocols. We owe our existence to it, and want to ensure that other protocols and apps can build on top of LogX to unlock new value props.",

      "description": "Metronome is a new DeFi synthetics ecosystem that has both innovated and iterated upon what existed prior in the decentralized synthetic space, creating a secure, user friendly dApp, where users are able to supercharge their yield generation and trade crypto assets in a capital efficient manner.  Metronome has three main components:  Synth, Marketplace, and Smart Farming.\n\nMetronome Synth: Where users can deposit collateral, mint synthetics, and manage their positions.  While similar to other synthetic applications, Metronome Synth separates itself from other products by allowing users to deposit multiple forms of collateral, including yield bearing productive collateral such as LST’s and Vesper Pool share tokens, which act as singular source of collateral value that users can then mint a variety of ever expanding synthetic assets from.  \n\nMetronome Marketplace:  The Marketplace is a synthetic DEX, where users can swap between synthetic assets with zero slippage and low fees.  Through Synth and the Marketplace, users are able to place directional trades on popular crypto assets.  DEX aggregators can also route trades through the marketplace to find the best prices on exotic assets, in a capital efficient manner.\n\nSmart Farming: A yield looping engine that routes through Metronome Synth and Vesper Finance yield strategies.  Smart Farming is the backbone of Metronome, enabling users to effortlessly loop their collateral for increased yield up to 5x.  Through Smart Farming, Metronome is able to offer users industry leading APYs, while maintaining sustainable yield.  ",

      "description": "Umbra is a stealth address privacy protocol for EVM networks. Umbra is one of the preeminent privacy tools available on Optimism since its launch in March 2022. In that time, is has processed over $200 Million in asset value. Nearly 14,000 addresses have registered to receive private payments, and more than 69,000 transactions have been occurred. As a tool for private payments, Umbra is especially useful on an L2 network like Optimism, where low fees make the payments use case more tenable than mainnet. Umbra also launched on Base in April 2024.\n\nScopeLift, the creators of Umbra, have also contributed to several EIPs to help standardize stealth addresses for all EVM networks. It is our hope these standardization efforts will be the next step to making Stealth Address technology broadly accessible and useful to all in the ecosystem.",

The fixed price of music is suffocating artists, with streaming services refusing to unlock the full value of music and failing to allow music fans to directly support artists. As a result, only 0.1% of musicians make a living wage from their art.\n\nOn Sound, artists can release their music and sell digital collectibles to their fans. Listeners can discover and collect new music to prove they were an early supporter and engage with their favorite artists. For the first time, curators can create playlists and share their favorite songs and earn alongside the artists.",

This allows users to discover new Optimism dapps and identify the next project to use and invest in, educating and bridging DappRadar users into the Optimism ecosystem. \nAdditionally, DappRadar has made more integrations and support for Optimism Collective dapps by integrating the biggest Superchain - Base in August 2023, providing even more insights to users. On top of that, the team at DappRadar created numerous pieces of content to highlight positive Optimism activity within the dapp industry. DappRadar has recently allowed for projects on Optimism to create quests on the platform for free and distribute rewards (tokens, NFTs) directly from the Optimism network.",

We build tools and educational content to teach the next wave of builders how/what they can build on Ethereum / EVMs.\n\n- **Tooling**: We built and actively maintain [🏗 Scaffold-ETH-2](https://scaffoldeth.io/), an open-source toolkit which allows for rapid prototyping and full scale dApp development on Ethereum.  \nWe have also lots of handy tools (OSS) created with SE-2 by our community, like [Abi.Ninja](https://abi.ninja/), [Hacked Wallet Recovery,](https://hackedwalletrecovery.com/) [address.vision](http://address.vision) and others.\n\n- **Education**: We provide a free curriculum at 🏃‍♀️ SpeedRunEthereum.com. A hands on, guided series of challenges to learn how to code and deploy smart contracts all while receiving the assistance of our community. \nWe also conduct monthly batches with developers who have just finished SRE, in which we encourage teamwork and collaboration among them, developing a group project.\nAlso lots of content in youtube, like BG Labs, Web2 to Web3, BG Episodes, among other video series, and IRL talks and workshops in ETH Global, Edcon and other events.\n\n- **Small Grants** We have different funding mechanisms to support high-impact devs, like BuidlGuidl streams, Cohort Streams towards a common objective, Ecosystem impact grants and BG Community Grants.\n\nKudzu Exchange, OE40 and Sand Garden Cohort are examples of dapps built by us with Scaffold-ETH and Scaffold-ETH 2, deployed on Base and Optimism.",

It's a purely frontend app that can easily run on IPFS, without any centralized web2 dependency needed (e.g. a centralized database). Its codebase is open source, which means that anyone can run their own instance of ModeChat, displaying the same content as other instances.\n\nThe purpose of ModeChat is to provide Mode users with a decentralized place to chat, share ideas and knowledge, and have fun onchain. It shows users the future of social networks and the world of blockchain dApps beyond just financial use cases.",

These models are accessible via the TITLES image editor, which enables creators to leverage these models or remix individual NFTs directly to create new works of art that “sample” or “remix” existing tokens or collections. The underlying TITLES Protocol enables users to publish these referential works of art as new NFT collections, where proceeds are automatically split between the creator and the creators of any models or media that they sampled.

      "description": "Trash NFTs is a project built on Base that leverages the unique properties of the ERC404 token standard. We had the idea for Trash NFTs as a way to combine artichokelord’s incredible artwork with novel tech to create something fun that pushed the boundaries of what’s possible for a memecoin. We chose to build Trash NFTs on Base because we believe in the future of the Superchain and the supportive community of builders it fosters.\n\nBetween the two contracts associated with Trash NFTs, the project has generated over 1300 onchain transactions.\n\nDemo video: https://youtu.be/KORe_xnJx1w?si=6V52TlkOfLz3hySz\nVideo of artichokelord drawing the art: https://warpcast.com/trashnfts/0xc65d2a4e\n\nERC404 is an experimental token standard pioneered by Pandora on February 2, 2024. ERC404 tokens embrace characteristics of both ERC20 and ERC721 tokens: They are “semi-fungible,” enabling both highly liquid markets and uniqueness within a single asset. This allows collectors to sell their tokens when they want and in pieces, if they’d like, as well as introduces the ability to reroll your NFT traits by making more transactions. ERC404s are inherently fractionalized and designed to work natively with existing DeFi protocols. While innovative, it’s important to note that ERC404 is also experimental.\n\nWhen we first launched $TRASH, we forked Pandora’s contract and raced to be one of the first, if not the first project to deploy an ERC404 on Base. Pandora’s contract was limited to 5 variations of artwork, images that implied a reveal down the line, so we followed suit with 5 closed-lid NFTs of different rarities. Our next goal was to have a PFP collection with the lids removed, so we came up with the idea to create a new contract where you could stash your $TRASH and mint a Dumpster Diver. This contract is named The Dumpster. It is open source and available to any other ERC404 token that wishes to fork it to enable their holders to redeem their ERC404 token for an ERC721.\n\nIn addition to the ability to mint an ERC721 by depositing an ERC404, the Dumpster contract enables holders of Dumpster Divers PFP tokens to burn their ERC721 to redeem the original ERC404 that the ERC721 was minted with (retaining the rarity and token ID). A small cleaning fee (0.00042069 ETH, updatable by governance) is charged, and this mechanism can also be used for regenerating/rerolling or ‘recycling’, Dumpster Diver PFPs to get the desired traits.\n\nWe have grown to 185 holders and have generated $44k from trade fees (50% of which is $TRASH and 100% of which is reinvested in providing liquidity for our pools), and 1,654,148 DEGEN (~$40k) from liquidity mining rewards. We were also a finalist in the Backdrop Build V3 Accelerator Program (top 5% of applicants). \n\nTrash NFTs have built an effective machine: by owning the LPs that facilitate the swaps into $TRASH we capture 1% of the volume and store that in our treasury. We have two liquidity pools: 1) TRASH/ETH and 2) TRASH/ DEGEN, the rapidly growing meme token with utility in the Farcaster network and beyond. This exposes Trash NFTs to volatility, which generates more revenue because arbitrage bots stabilize the price across pools. \n\nTrash NFTs is also governed by a DAO called Waste Management that was initially allocated 20% of all $TRASH tokens. This DAO collects the cleaning fees associated with trait rerolls as well as the transaction fees and LP rewards from its DeFi activities. Finally, Trash NFTs has entered the meatspace by hosting a trash pickup event during Farcon 2024 with /humankind. \n\nWe are proud of Trash NFTs, as it has maintained and proven to be a sound investment for its holder base while operating successfully. There are definite improvements we continue working toward: 1) expanding growth efforts to the broader 404 ecosystem with partnerships (such as Scattering.io with which we have built a relationship) and promotion, 2) revamping The Dumpster website for a more seamless experience and 3) engaging the community to take leadership in expanding the DAO.",

It's the perfect name for a room that will be used for animals to decompress before they are diagnosed at the animal hospital onsite.\n\nThis governance vote introduced a new community of Base lovers to the Pawthereum project. Users who participated in this vote were airdropped Pawthereum tokens when Pawthereum migrated from Ethereum mainnet to Base in April. If they enjoyed using tokens to vote on fun governance proposals that help animals, they have like minded frens in the Pawthereum community!\n\nThe vote was conducted in a farcaster frame or on Pawthereum's custom build interface: Pawswap. Most users chose to vote via the frame and as far as I am aware, this is the first frame used for an onchain governance proposal! (Coinbase's frame followed shortly after with a vote on branding for a liquid death advertisement).",

      "description": "Reserve is a free, permissionless platform on Ethereum, Base and Arbitrum to build, deploy and govern asset-backed currencies referred to as “RTokens.” RTokens are always 1:1 asset-backed, allowing for permissionless minting and redeeming onchain.\n\nFor example, Electronic Dollar (eUSD) was the first RToken and is a safety-first stablecoin (backed by Aave and Compound deposits) that brings together diversified, highly liquid backing with anti-bank run overcollateralization that currently exceeds more than the value of the TVL of the RToken itself. eUSD has been chosen as the stablecoin for two retail user applications: 1) Ugly Cash - an app that gives bank-like services to customers throughout LatAm, enabling them to receive USD remittance from the US at 0% fee and spend their eUSD with a debit card. 2) Sentz - an app built on the MobileCoin blockchain that enables users to send and receive payments globally from anyone you can text for (basically) free.\n\nReserve Protocol has been live on Mainnet, Base, and Arbitrum collectively for over a year now with no security incidents. TVL has grown to over $160M, 8 major audits have been completed, and a $5M ImmuneFi bug bounty continues to contribute to the safety. Additionally, the overcollateralization to protect against depegs was put to test during the Silicon Valley related USDC depeg in March 2023, which led to a successful re-collateralization of eUSD holders.\n\nOn Base, Reserve Protocol has over $25m TVL on Base, $13m of which is Base Native with the remainder bridged from Mainnet. RTokens are playing a strong role in growing the DeFi ecosystem on Base with several integrations and deep liquidity. RToken pools account for over $30m of Total Pool TVL on Aerodrome alone. Growth of RTokens on Base also has second order benefits for the Base's DeFi ecosystem since RTokens are composed of other assets in the ecosystem. For example, hyUSD is a base-native flatcoin that is 100% backed by a collateral basket of USDC which is supplied on Aave and Compound to earn revenue, which is then distributed to hyUSD holders and governance stakers. The market cap of hyUSD has grown to a point where hyUSD collateral makes up 6% of all USDC supplied on Compound and 4% of all USDC supplied on Aave!\n\nI am Thomas Mattimore, CEO of ABC Labs - the Reserve Protocol Core Team. I have overseen overall strategy at Reserve and have overseen protocol growth from $23M to $160M TVL in the past 9 months.",

Over 1000 addresses were onboarded to Base in the first 48 hours by Basic Dog Meme, providing the substantial bulk of newly active wallets on the first day.\n\nSince then, Basic Dog Meme has:\n- Pioneered MemeFi by being the first Meme coin with a gauge on Aerodrome\n- Rallied a community of thousands of enthusiasts from multiple block chains and backgrounds to Base\n- Become an ambassador of the arts by becoming a patron to dozens of NFT artists who love the color blue\n- Was the focus of one of the first community initiatives to create a meme-coin driven L3 on Base, perhaps serving as the originator of that idea within the base community. An idea that was later executed and expanded upon by multiple other meme coin communities\n",

      "description": "Our project operates the most used veNFT Market in crypto, responsible for more veNFT trading volume than all other NFT Markets combined. It has saved users >355k USD in fees (compared to OpenSea, the second most used Marketplace for veNFTs). Its UI introduced tools for tracking locked amounts, unlock dates, etc. -- without which most users would be unable to safely trade these positions. It is the only any-erc20-for-any-erc721 contract that exists. We've seen >17.5M USD in volume across Superchain deployments. On Optimism, these contracts have facilitated more volume than all other NFT Market contracts combined since their release; they've accounted for > 4% of all NFT volume on Base. \n\nWe developed the only (non-deprecated) liquid staking project for veVELO. Its vote-matching program is the only such program of its kind that exists. This program allows projects and users alike to receive votes by pairing a token with opxVELO. Each week, a snapshot captures the amount of opxVELO in each pool, and the pool receives one vote for each opxVELO pooled. It has achieved its success without subsidy, grants, or outside funding. Its historical performance matches or bests the majority of all liquid staking projects for vote-escrow positions. \n\nOur tokens serve a function within our projects. They have been responsible for hundreds of thousands of transfers on Optimism. We originally deployed the Open X Project on Optimism in September of 2022. ",

Consequently, users have saved >355k USD in fees by using our marketplace for their veNFT transactions. Our revenue from these transactions by contrast was <200k USD. We have saved users substantially more in fees than we have taken. Our fees go toward supporting our infrastructure and investing in or providing liquidity for other Superchain native projects. \n\n100% revenue generated by the opxVELO project (~10k VELO / week, the value of which varies) is re-invested into the Velodrome ecosystem in the form of recycled partner project incentives, increased LP depth for partner projects (from transaction fees), and the buyback-and-burn mechanism that returns value to opxVELO users. (Note: VELO is bonded to our project via the opxVELO project, but for each VELO bonded the contract issues 1 opxVELO, meaning for each $1 of \"revenue\" bonded to opxVELO, $1 of liability is issued; we have therefore not counted bonds as revenue).

      "description": "Synonym is a universal cross-chain lending market for DeFi users across multiple ecosystems. We’re building the cross-chain lending and borrowing experience that users deserve, powered by the Wormhole cross-chain technology stack. Users can earn yield, borrow, repay and withdraw from any chain, all from a single unified interface. Our markets are truly cross-collateralized, meaning users can borrow on destination chains with source chain collateral, all without using other applications to wrap, unwrap and swap cross-chain assets. \n\nDeposit, earn, lend and borrow from anywhere. We're making chain boundaries a thing of the past. Synonym is currently deployed across multiple chains, including Optimism and Base. We operate on a unique hub and spoke architecture and plan on deploying even more spokes to OP Stack chains.",

Arcadia takes advantage of the composability of DeFi to combine different protocols in interesting ways to maximize yields while providing best-in-class execution that streamline the way users interface with underlying protocols.\n\nAn Arcadia \"Account\", the protocol's key primitive, allows users to gain access to greater leverage than incumbent money-markets while allowing the collateral assets and the borrowed assets to be used across third-party protocols. Actions that normally would require multiple transactions, like rebalancing portfolios, unwinding one position to enter another or creating complex leveraged positions, can be executed in a single transaction using an Account.",

This quarter we built a novel crypto game using Farcaster Frames and streaming $DEGEN tokens. We had over 870 players across two Seasons and more than 1.5M DEGEN distributed to them. Notable our churn was really low with over half the players playing over 5 times despite the .001 ETH entry price on Base. \n\nKing of the Degens is an Onchain RPG with real crypto stakes built on Farcaster. Up in the castle, the King and 9 court members are being streamed $DEGEN points in real-time. A player can **⚔️ STORM THE CASTLE ⚔️** to join the court by paying 0.001 ETH, which is swapped for $DEGEN and put in the Treasury for all to share.",

No code, no setup, no login, and free!\n\nCreateMyToken has helped create over 50,000 tokens since its inception and continues to do so today, for free and with easy to use tools. A usual token deployment on an L2 like Base costs less than a cent, and enables unlimited potential.\n\nWe're also working on a special SuperERC20 right now which enables deployment across the superchain on the same address and with interchangeable balances via universal bridging. It will enable tokens to exist across the entire Superchain seamlessly.",

In less than 2 days, over 3000 people created over 10,000 different assets (Many OP users tried Arweave for the first time, and many Arweave users were introduced to Optimism as well).\n\nHowever, Bodhi is a highly abstract protocol. To help people understand that you can build almost ANY protocol or apps on it (including Twitter, YouTube, TikTok, Mirror, Steam, GitHub, etc.), we ourselves built the very first app protocol on Bodhi, with only 60 lines of code, called Bodhi Space. It's basically a Reddit, and anyone can create their own space for any topic without permission and it's completely unstoppable. All contents and replies can be upvoted with ETH (because they are all Bodhi assets). Released in April 2024, Bodhi Space had over 90 different spaces in less than 2 days.\n\nWe'll build more protocols on Bodhi with developers from all over the world, covering different fields. This is just the beginning. In the next 10 years, we'll see Github on Bodhi, Steam on Bodhi, Twitter on Bodhi. Communities and foundations on Bodhi...",

We introduced social tipping using emojis called Floaties and support over 25 coins on Base. These tips are sent instantly to the recipients wallet and are supported on Warpcast and Twitter. That's right you can send coins directly to your friends using the social feed and emojis. To date over 378,000 Floaties have been sent and over 73,000 transactions submitted. \n\nWe also have an off-chain tipping mechanism where people can tip Warpcast posts they like using the Ham emoji 🍖. People receive a daily allocation of Ham based on their community points.\n\nThe Ham ecosystem is backed by a memecoin on Base called $TN100x. Part of Ham, I launched an NFT project called The Based LP. Each Based LP is backed by a certain amount of $TN100x. The NFT can be burnt to redeem the $TN100x - 60% of the backing is redeemed immediately while the remaining 40% goes to backing the remaining NFTs.\n\nWe also recently launched $PHAM - an index style asset backed by 6 Base memecoins. Through owning a single token you get exposure to all 6. \n\nLastly we are launching Ham chain next week. Its an L3 built using the OP stack. ",

      "description": "Giveth is an open-source, radically transparent, user-friendly donation platform that supports verified public goods projects to raise crypto with zero added fees and no intermediaries. We build and advance novel fundraising mechanisms like quadratic funding, donor rewards, and decentralized project curation.\n\n## Giveth supports P2P donations on Optimism and Base.  \n\nGiveth has been live on Optimism since 2023, enabling projects to accept Optimism donations (approx. $330k USD raised by hundreds of projects on OP Mainnet as of June 5, 2024). Donations on Giveth are truly P2P without even contracts in the middle, so the donations we facilitate in the platform can't be included in our metrics in this application.\n\nThrough our GIVbacks program, we reward donors to verified projects with GIV on Optimism, having distributed  6.64 million GIV on OP Mainnet (from launch to June 11, 2024).  \n\nAs an additional onboarding effort for high-trust community members, we have been offering 25 OP to each project on Giveth who passes our verification system requirements, and adds an Optimism recipient address (296 projects onboarded so far). \n\nTo enhance these onboarding efforts, we have been running quadratic funding rounds that require verified projects to add an Optimism address, with matching pools on Optimism so far totaling approximately $83,000. \n\n## How it works\n\nGiveth goes beyond “just donations” with the following features:\n\n* GIVbacks - Donors who give to verified public goods projects get rewarded with GIV on OP Mainnet. This flips the script on tax-deductible donation, creating a decentralized and borderless way of incentivizing donations.\n* GIVpower - Users can lock their GIV tokens on OP Mainnet to earn a yield and get GIVpower. People can use GIVpower to boost/curate projects on the platform. Projects with more GIVpower are ranked higher, and in turn, their donors are rewarded with more GIVbacks, similar to the veToken model. Top-boosted projects also appear higher on Giveth!\n* Quadratic Funding - The democratic matching program popularized by Gitcoin is also available on Giveth! Projects and donors enjoy multi-chain donation rounds with an easy and streamlined user experience.\n\n## Who uses it\n\nCurrently, over 3,400 projects have raised $2.8m from 58,600+ donations from over 16,600 donor addresses on Giveth. \n\nTo understand how deep our link with the Optimism ecosystem is, if we consider only Optimism numbers, we have 799 projects, 4012 donors, 17,500+ donations, and $329k+.\n\nProjects that want to get to the next level can apply to be “Verified” as a public goods creator, providing information about their impact history and reputation at stake.\n\nGiveth is onboarding real-world impact projects to web3 by empowering them with free access to novel fundraising mechanisms and new ecosystems of donors, while inspiring them to dive deeper down the blockchain rabbit hole.\n\nSo far in 2024, we have made HUGE progress, running four quadratic funding rounds supporting donations on Optimism with the following results:\n\nTotal in matching pools: $107,563\nIndividual donations: $65,500\nProjects participating: 249 \nUnique donors: 1914\nDonations: 1433\n\nGiving Season Round  (December 19, 2023 - January 2, 2024)\nhttps://forum.giveth.io/t/qf-giving-season-round-results-december-19-2023-january-2-2024/1305\n\nMetaPool APAC Round (February 19-29, 2024)\nhttps://forum.giveth.io/t/meta-pool-apac-qf-round-results-feb-19-29-2024/1358\n\nENS Builders Round (March 25-April 8, 2024)\nhttps://forum.giveth.io/t/ens-builders-qf-round-march-25-april-8-2024/1410\n\nGalactic Giving Round (May 2-16, 2024)\nhttps://forum.giveth.io/t/galactic-giving-round-results-may-2-16-2024/1445\n\nWe also launched loads of features including a custom donation widget, a project curation program, and streaming donations.\n\nWe sincerely thank the Optimistic community for allowing us to participate and build in such a fantastic ecosystem.\n",

In terms of TVL metrics, we currently host $2.8mm in trading liquidity, $2.7mm in staked tokens, and $3.3mm in combined pool2 liquidity! We've also processed over $295mm in volume across our Classic and Freestyle markets since launch, attracting >21.4k users!\n\nTraders and liquidity providers can earn stackable yield on their deposited collateral/liquidity through BMX’s innovative asset: wBLT. \n\nwBLT auto-compounds BLT liquidity rewards, removing the need to manually claim yield for the user. Then, it can be utilized as a collateral asset, to borrow stables or other bluechip assets against it while continuing to earn yield. \n\nwBLT can also be utilized as a pool2 paired asset, enabling stackable yield for the user, from both perpetual markets in addition to pool2 liquidity rewards!

Every day brings a new track, and players can mint Race Result NFTs to immortalize their best laps, get on the leaderboard and earn points towards a season championship.\n\nSpeedtracer is free to play and doesn't require a wallet, but uses onchain mechanics for paid premium players and immutable incentive alignment between players, partners and the game developer. The project aims to onboard new crypto users through casual gaming and is working towards better serving these players through smoother wallet onboarding, cheaper premium play and more mainstream brand partners.\n\nSpeedtracer tracks are onchain SVG NFTs. Each track starts off as a generative artwork created by a Solidity algorithm. Track NFT owners can customize the shape and color theme, then place additional artwork around the track. We partner with other web3 projects to create branded tracks that partners use to engage their community and gain positive brand impressions. ",

A `power user` is defined as an address that has made at least 100 transactions, across at least 10 different projects, on at least 30 days, over the RF4 scope period. A project is counted by this metric if has at least one interaction from a power user. Power users are critical early adopters for the ecosystem.",

EigenTrust, aka OpenRank, is a reputation algorithm being applied by Karma3Labs to the Farcaster social graph. To seed the \"web of trust\", we begin with a list of 132 badgeholder addresses, look up their Farcaster IDs (present for 68 of the 132 addresses), and use OpenRank to identify those users' 100 closest connections. The result is a set of around 5000 addresses that have the closest social connection to the badgeholder community. Finally, we counts the number of addresses in the web of trust who have interacted with a given project. Note: this is an experimental metric designed and results in an even smaller but potentially higher signal subset of users than the \"trusted user\" model applied elsewhere.",

      "description": "Sum of a project's total contribution to gas fees across the Superchain over the RF4 scope period October 2023 - June 2024, adjusted to a logarithmic scale. Gas fees are the primary recurring revenue source for the Superchain and a key indicator of aggregate blockspace demand. A project’s gas fee contribution is influenced by its total volume of contract interactions, the computational complexity of those interactions, and the state of the underlying gas market at the time of those transactions. In the long run, gas fees are what will power Retro Funding and enable it to continue in perpetuity. All members of the Superchain have committed at least 15% of their gross profit from gas fees to Retro Funding. Supporting projects that generate revenue in the form of gas fees helps power the economic engine of the Superchain. This indicator is transformed to a logarithmic scale (log10(gas_fees + 1)). Logarithmic scales are useful for metrics that span several orders of magnitude such as gas fees and transactions and have strong compounding effects. On a log scale, a project with an impact metric value of 100 (10^2) is 2X more impactful than one with a value of 10 (10^1), not 10X. Badgeholders are advised to use either a log scale or a normal (linear) scale in their ballots, not both.",

Optimism is a Layer 2 roll-up designed to improve the transaction throughput and reduce the fees on Ethereum. Layer 2s are crucial for scaling Ethereum because they help address the network's congestion issues without compromising its security or decentralization. Transaction counts are an important indicator for assessing the adoption and usage of all the new blockspace made available by the Superchain. Projects that have a sustained, high transaction count provide a clear signal of network growth and blockspace demand. This indicator includes successful transactions with a to_address owned by the project, as well as internal transactions that originate from one of the project's contracts and interact with the canonical EntryPoint (EIP 4337) contracts.

Bots, airdrop farming, and sybil attacks are longstanding problems in crypto. This metric is designed to filter out these types of interactions and focus on the activity of a small subset of trusted users (less than 5% of all active addresses on the Superchain). By tracking interactions specifically from trusted users, we gain a picture of blockspace demand that is less influenced by the effects of bots / farmers / sybils. A \"trusted user\" represents an address linked to an account the meets a certain threshold of reputation. Currently, there are several teams in the Optimism ecosystem building reputation models in a privacy-preserving way. This metric aggregates reputation data from multiple platforms (Farcaster, Passport, EigenTrust by Karma3Labs), and the Optimist NFT collection. In order to be consider a trusted user, an address must meet at least two of the following requirements as of 2024-05-21: have a Farcaster ID of 20939, have a Passport score of 20 points or higher, have a Karma3Labs EigenTrust GlobalRank in the top 42,000 of Farcaster users, hold an Optimist NFT in their wallet, or qualified for at least two (out of four) Optimism airdrops.
