    "description": "This project enables MUTATIO ERC1155 NFTs by XCOPY x NeonGlitch86 to be wrapped into an ERC20 token called $FLIES, which allows access to a more efficient way of trading this asset via a DEX.\nMUTATIO is the biggest open edition mint to date and was dropped on Base mid of March 2024 with over 1M pieces minted. ~58% of the supply have already been wrapped into $FLIES and XCOPY has officially acknowledged the project.\nI created this in a solo mission and I'm still the only developer working on it but the project is community run by now.\nWintermute and @seedphrase are among the biggest supporters.\nI'm currently looking into creating an open edition mint platform for artists where all of the proceeds in $FLIES are burned. Every OE platform that already exists takes a cut of the proceeds so I'll be building my own!",

    "description": "Coop Records is an onchain record label.\n\nWe’ve released 268 songs from 70+ artists - driving 200k mints across 70k unique collectors. You can see this data here - https://dune.com/coop_records/coop-recs\n\nWe release ~10 new songs per week and are driving mints to these records using the OP we received from RetroPGF Round 3.\n\nIn total we have distributed ~31.6k OP in incentives across platforms like Boost, Layer3 and Coinvise - driving value back to our artists and our catalog with more than 100 ETH in total earnings.\n\nThis can be tracked by using our address - 0x512b55b00d744fC2eDB8474f223a7498c3e5a7ce to see our stats through Sealaunch - https://dune.com/sealaunch/boost-creator-custom-dashboard\n\nWe set up wallets for these artists, manage all splits and backend payouts, uploads, marketing and onchain distribution across Warpcast and Boost + Layer3. Coop Records is an end-to-end service provider responsible for facilitating the vast majority of mints for our artists.\n\nWe are the biggest power user of Boost and placed first in every week of the Boost Creator Fund over the course of May as seen here: https://dune.com/boost_xyz/boost-creator-fund/b9be8e45-93dc-4ea7-83e4-23d23899e9f7\n\nOutside of releasing music onchain, Coop Records is active as a product builder - having incubated projects like:\n\n- Sonata.tips - a music discovery platform on Farcaster\n- Boombox.fm - a consumer crypto app to share your favorite artists\n- Farconcert - onchain tickets for the Farcon official afterparty\n- Frame Generator - a recurring tool to generate new Frames for every Coop Records releases.\n\nThe main focus being onchain points systems deployed on a Base L3 in partnership with Stack. Our contracts have facilitated more than 150k transactions - largely from users who have never touched crypto before. https://explorer.stack.so/address/0xab18FdC21c33c3C60bbcA753997a657F00d43F9e\n\nWe’re actively growing our onchain subscribers through Coop Records Club - a partnership with Hypersub which gives our community of 250 collectors an airdrop of every release.\nhttps://hypersub.withfabric.xyz/collection/coop-records-club-izh68wci0c8w\n\nCoop Records recently started a new podcast series - which has driven 23k mints across our first 5 episodes. https://pods.media/coop-records\n\nCoop Records also participated as a judge in the We Love the Art competition and helped 25+ artists apply.\n\nAs a record label - it is important for Coop Records to build on top of underlying platforms and protocols. We believe our impact is noticeable and tangible - and wanted to apply for the Onchain Builders round as a more direct way of receiving OP to reinvest into our artists and our community.\n\nWe are in close contact with partners like Sound, Pods, Boost and Layer3 about their Onchain Builder application - but want to vocalize that we have been instrumental in the impact these projects have made on their contracts.\n\nAs a capable dev team - the results of this round will be crucial in our decision to keep building on these shared platforms, versus deciding to build our own. We believe strongly in the network effects of shared contracts, but will not sacrifice our ability to capture value for our artists if it boxes us out of being able to tangibly measure and show the impact we are creating onchain.\n\nWe hope that this description can shine a light on the full scope of the Coop Records ecosystem and look forward to continuing to champion Optimism and Retro Funding in the years to come.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration,\n\nCoop Records Team",

Coop Records is an end-to-end service provider responsible for facilitating the vast majority of mints for our artists.\n\nWe are the biggest power user of Boost and placed first in every week of the Boost Creator Fund over the course of May as seen here: https://dune.com/boost_xyz/boost-creator-fund/b9be8e45-93dc-4ea7-83e4-23d23899e9f7\n\nOutside of releasing music onchain, Coop Records is active as a product builder - having incubated projects like:\n\n- Sonata.tips - a music discovery platform on Farcaster\n- Boombox.fm - a consumer crypto app to share your favorite artists\n- Farconcert - onchain tickets for the Farcon official afterparty\n- Frame Generator - a recurring tool to generate new Frames for every Coop Records releases.\n\nThe main focus being onchain points systems deployed on a Base L3 in partnership with Stack. Our contracts have facilitated more than 150k transactions - largely from users who have never touched crypto before. https://explorer.stack.so/address/0xab18FdC21c33c3C60bbcA753997a657F00d43F9e\n\nWe’re actively growing our onchain subscribers through Coop Records Club - a partnership with Hypersub which gives our community of 250 collectors an airdrop of every release.\nhttps://hypersub.withfabric.xyz/collection/coop-records-club-izh68wci0c8w\n\nCoop Records recently started a new podcast series - which has driven 23k mints across our first 5 episodes. https://pods.media/coop-records\n\nCoop Records also participated as a judge in the We Love the Art competition and helped 25+ artists apply.\n\nAs a record label - it is important for Coop Records to build on top of underlying platforms and protocols. We believe our impact is noticeable and tangible - and wanted to apply for the Onchain Builders round as a more direct way of receiving OP to reinvest into our artists and our community.\n\nWe are in close contact with partners like Sound, Pods, Boost and Layer3 about their Onchain Builder application - but want to vocalize that we have been instrumental in the impact these projects have made on their contracts.\n\nAs a capable dev team - the results of this round will be crucial in our decision to keep building on these shared platforms, versus deciding to build our own. We believe strongly in the network effects of shared contracts, but will not sacrifice our ability to capture value for our artists if it boxes us out of being able to tangibly measure and show the impact we are creating onchain.\n\nWe hope that this description can shine a light on the full scope of the Coop Records ecosystem and look forward to continuing to champion Optimism and Retro Funding in the years to come.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration,\n\nCoop Records Team",

    "description": "Minibridge is a \"zero-fee\" cross-chain tool that offers multi-chain support for BTC/EVM/non-EVM and features such as fast transactions. It was developed by the Chaineye team specifically for users' small-amount transfer scenarios. Launched for less than half a year, Minibridge has already processed 300K transactions and served 100K Web3 users. In user ratings on dappsheriff.com, Minibridge ranks first among all cross-chain bridge projects and was awarded \"Best Tool of the Year\" in the \"PARTY AWARD 2024\" annual selection by PA News.\n\nKey Features\n\nChaineye was born from the Web3 community and we build products for the community’s needs. To better serve the community, Chaineye has built many free tools such as Onchain Map, CEX Transfer Fees, Multichain Gas, RPC List, etc. The Mini Bridge was designed specifically for retail investors with small-amount cross-chain transfer requests, including the following features:\n\nZero bridge fees: We don’t charge any bridge fees at all. This means users will get the same amount of assets on the destination chains. We are built for retail investors and we believe our community like free services. Only a minimum gas fee on the destination chain is charged.\n\nFastest transactions: Our bridge has the fastest bridging experience across all existing bridges. The bridging time largely depends on the confirmation time of source and destination blockchains. We don’t want our users to wait any longer than the evitable blockchain transaction time.\n\nDesigned especially for small-amount transfer scenarios such as gas refill, airdrop claiming, moving funds, etc. It helps to save huge money and time for individual investors when doing so.\n\nGas swap: Our community wants to use the destination chain directly after bridging. We get it! The gas swap feature allows users to swap a small amount of source chain ETH to the destination chain native gas token. It is very useful for those chains where ETH is not the native gas token such as BNB Chain, Polygon, ZetaChain, ZkFair, Avalanche, Map, Mantle, and Metis.\n\nFast Integration: Our team is monitoring the market closely and is ready to integrate the latest blockchains in time. Chaineye Mini Bridge currently supports a total of 24 networks including the latest Blast EVM L2 and Merlin BTC L2 blockchain.\n\nOpen API: We have opened the API docs on our documentation site. Any individuals or third parties can go through the API and seamlessly integrate Mini Bridge into their application. Chaineye Mini Bridge works in the same style for both requests from our front-end UI and API endpoints.\n\nSecurity: To prevent the potential security concern of smart contracts, we have implemented our bridge in a hybrid style - a combination of EOA and smart contracts. EOA for cross-chain transfers and smart contracts for cross-chain gas swaps. It helps to reduce the possibility of contract exploitation. In addition, we have our entire system audited and scrutinized by our security partners.\n\nRewards and Earn: Our users can enjoy a big bridge discount by participating in our various marketing campaigns. In addition, they can also earn referral rewards in ETH and $pMNB whenever their referred address makes a transfer. Everything is transparent and Chaineye Mini Bridge is built for the community.\n\nValue Proposition\nMiniBridge extends its liquidity aggregation services to all major OP stacks, including Optimism, Base, Zora, Mode, Fraxtal, and Redstone, enabling community users on all other chains to interact with the OP ecosystem. We are aiming to foster collaboration and engagement between our respective communities, helping OP and Chaineye users to transfer their assets freely across any supported blockchains with the lowest fees and the highest speed. \nMiniBridge was born from the community and built for the community. Our web3 community BitEye having over 300K active users is the largest Asian crypto community. MiniBridge will help bring BitEye to OP ecosystem with many highlights and marketing resources which will help both sides to grow into the next level. \nMiniBridge address on most blockchains is an EOA: 0x00000000000007736e2F9aA5630B8c812E1F3fc9. Since the birth of MiniBridge (roughly 6 months ago), it has made cumulatively 338,031 bridging transactions on all chains and 28,705 bridging transactions on Optimism and all supported OP stack blockchains. \n\nProject Resource\n\nWebsite: https://minibridge.chaineye.tools/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Chaineye_tools\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/chaineye\n\nGithub: https://github.com/DeFiEye\n\nDocumentation: https://docs.chaineye.tools/\n",

I have been contributing to the web3 space for the last four years, previously serving as a core team member at InfinityPools as a Solidity Engineer and as the CTO at Chill Finance. DeFiLens is a chain abstraction DApp, Which I started to increase user engagement in the DeFi space by simplifying DeFi across chains. We recently launched our MVP and have gained traction, receiving grants from Base Network and Devfolio. Our team of three is continuously improving the product and user acquisition.\n\nWhat is DeFiLens:\nDeFiLens simplifies decentralized finance (DeFi) trading and portfolio management across multiple blockchain networks. It provides a cross-chain rebalancer tool that helps traders manage, diversify, and optimize their portfolios seamlessly. By abstracting the complexities of network switching, asset bridging, and multiple transactions, DeFiLens offers a unified interface that enhances efficiency, reduces gas fees, and automates strategic rebalancing. This enables users to maximize returns and minimize risks in the rapidly evolving DeFi landscape.\n\nHow It Is Going:\nWe have executed 450 cross-chain batches successfully on 4 EVM chains. Each batch contains around 25 transactions, which we simplified into one transaction with a single click. We built DeFiLens frames on Warpcast, garnering around 2,000 views and 200 users trying out our DeFi frames.",

By integrating $blue into various products and services, we ensure continuous value addition to the ecosystem, promoting long-term growth.\n\nWe aim to develop a range of practical and engaging products that use $blue as both a payment option and a value accumulator. This will create a sustainable economy for $blue holders and continuously add value to the ecosystem.\n\n$blue is the first-ever metameme, blending memes, art, and culture into a single, vibrant movement. It unifies all blue-themed meme coins into a unique digital experience, representing innovation in the web3 realm and challenging the traditional meme economy.\n\nBy leveraging $blue, we will create an ecosystem where users can easily integrate $blue into their digital activities. \n\nOur diverse product range will enhance the utility of $blue, strengthen its role in digital culture, and support a growing and engaged community.\n\nEcosystem Product Vision\n\n1. Yield Farming (readiness 95%)\n\nIntroduce yield farming opportunities where users can stake their $blue tokens in liquidity pools to earn additional rewards.\n\n2. PvP Games (in progress)\n\nDevelop Telegram miniapps and standalone games that enable users to engage in player-versus-player (PvP) games, using $blue tokens for in-game transactions and rewards.\n\n3. TG Mini Apps (in progress)\n\nDevelop “The Blue Meme Coin Challenge” - an engaging idle game within Telegram where players create and manage meme coin projects. \n\nTelegram mini apps are the perfect tool to attract a huge audience and create an effective funnel for user acquisition. \n\nBy offering interactive and gamified experiences, our mini app will captivate users, keeping them engaged and active within the $blue ecosystem. \n\n4. $blue integrations with other projects (in progress)\n\nEnable payments and transactions within partner apps using $blue tokens, making them a practical and functional part of users' daily routines.\n\nThis not only boosts the utility and demand for $blue but also reinforces its role as a versatile and valuable digital currency within the broader ecosystem.\n\n5. NFTs (readiness 95%)\n\nIntegrating NFTs into the $blue ecosystem adds layers of value, engagement, and community interaction, making it a robust and appealing digital environment.\n\n6. \n\nBlockchain and Crypto Education: Launch an educational platform offering courses, tutorials, and resources on blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, and the $blue ecosystem, incentivizing learning with $blue tokens.\n\nVirtual Conferences and Meetups: Host virtual events, conferences, and meetups within the $blue ecosystem, using $blue tokens for access and participation.\n",

    "description": "dHEDGE is a decentralized non-custodial tokenized vault protocol built on Ethereum L2’s including Optimism and Base. It has amassed a total TVL of about $100M across networks, and has been live since 2020. \n\nThe protocol facilitates  non-custodial management of assets between individuals seeking to allocate funds and vault managers with an onchain track record of performance. These vault managers have special privileges including trading assets on depositors behalf, using whitelisted protocols, collecting management fees, and making updates to the tradable assets of vaults. In addition, users can utilize automatic yield and leveraged vaults.\n\nThrough these vaults, structured products can be created using automation, such as mStable and Toros Finance. Some of the successful products include: derivative, yield, and index vaults.\n\n653 vaults are deployed across Optimism and Base by the dHEDGE factory contracts.",

    "description": "dHEDGE is a decentralized non-custodial tokenized vault protocol built on Ethereum L2’s including Optimism and Base. It has amassed a total TVL of about $100M across networks, and has been live since 2020. \n\nThe protocol facilitates  non-custodial management of assets between individuals seeking to allocate funds and vault managers with an onchain track record of performance. These vault managers have special privileges including trading assets on depositors behalf, using whitelisted protocols, collecting management fees, and making updates to the tradable assets of vaults. In addition, users can utilize automatic yield and leveraged vaults.\n\nThrough these vaults, structured products can be created using automation, such as mStable and Toros Finance. Some of the successful products include: derivative, yield, and index vaults.\n\n653 vaults are deployed across Optimism and Base by the dHEDGE factory contracts.",

For Gamma vaults, 15% of swap fees go to Gamma for their services, while 35% stays with the protocol. For manual liquidity providers (LPs) not set up as a gauge, the LPs will earn all the swap fees.\n\nSince we haven't released our token and veToken yet—they're coming on June 17th—we're keeping the swap fees allocated to veBXT voters for now. These will be added as bribes to the corresponding pool. As for protocol revenue, the team won't keep it all; we'll share part of it with the future BaseX DAO.

For Gamma vaults, 15% of swap fees go to Gamma for their services, while 35% stays with the protocol. For manual liquidity providers (LPs) not set up as a gauge, the LPs will earn all the swap fees.\n\nSince we haven't released our token and veToken yet—they're coming on June 17th—we're keeping the swap fees allocated to veBXT voters for now. These will be added as bribes to the corresponding pool. As for protocol revenue, the team won't keep it all; we'll share part of it with the future BaseX DAO. There will be another governance token for the DAO, which will be airdropped to our IDP/LBP investors and early supporters."

    "description": "Minibridge is a \"zero-fee\" cross-chain tool that offers multi-chain support for BTC/EVM/non-EVM and features such as fast transactions. It was developed by the Chaineye team specifically for users' small-amount transfer scenarios. Launched for less than half a year, Minibridge has already processed 300K transactions and served 100K Web3 users. In user ratings on dappsheriff.com, Minibridge ranks first among all cross-chain bridge projects and was awarded \"Best Tool of the Year\" in the \"PARTY AWARD 2024\" annual selection by PA News.\n\nKey Features\n\nChaineye was born from the Web3 community and we build products for the community’s needs. To better serve the community, Chaineye has built many free tools such as Onchain Map, CEX Transfer Fees, Multichain Gas, RPC List, etc. The Mini Bridge was designed specifically for retail investors with small-amount cross-chain transfer requests, including the following features:\n\nZero bridge fees: We don’t charge any bridge fees at all. This means users will get the same amount of assets on the destination chains. We are built for retail investors and we believe our community like free services. Only a minimum gas fee on the destination chain is charged.\n\nFastest transactions: Our bridge has the fastest bridging experience across all existing bridges. The bridging time largely depends on the confirmation time of source and destination blockchains. We don’t want our users to wait any longer than the evitable blockchain transaction time.\n\nDesigned especially for small-amount transfer scenarios such as gas refill, airdrop claiming, moving funds, etc. It helps to save huge money and time for individual investors when doing so.\n\nGas swap: Our community wants to use the destination chain directly after bridging. We get it! The gas swap feature allows users to swap a small amount of source chain ETH to the destination chain native gas token. It is very useful for those chains where ETH is not the native gas token such as BNB Chain, Polygon, ZetaChain, ZkFair, Avalanche, Map, Mantle, and Metis.\n\nFast Integration: Our team is monitoring the market closely and is ready to integrate the latest blockchains in time. Chaineye Mini Bridge currently supports a total of 24 networks including the latest Blast EVM L2 and Merlin BTC L2 blockchain.\n\nOpen API: We have opened the API docs on our documentation site. Any individuals or third parties can go through the API and seamlessly integrate Mini Bridge into their application. Chaineye Mini Bridge works in the same style for both requests from our front-end UI and API endpoints.\n\nSecurity: To prevent the potential security concern of smart contracts, we have implemented our bridge in a hybrid style - a combination of EOA and smart contracts. EOA for cross-chain transfers and smart contracts for cross-chain gas swaps. It helps to reduce the possibility of contract exploitation. In addition, we have our entire system audited and scrutinized by our security partners.\n\nRewards and Earn: Our users can enjoy a big bridge discount by participating in our various marketing campaigns. In addition, they can also earn referral rewards in ETH and $pMNB whenever their referred address makes a transfer. Everything is transparent and Chaineye Mini Bridge is built for the community.\n\nValue Proposition\nMiniBridge extends its liquidity aggregation services to all major OP stacks, including Optimism, Base, Zora, Mode, Fraxtal, and Redstone, enabling community users on all other chains to interact with the OP ecosystem. We are aiming to foster collaboration and engagement between our respective communities, helping OP and Chaineye users to transfer their assets freely across any supported blockchains with the lowest fees and the highest speed. \nMiniBridge was born from the community and built for the community. Our web3 community BitEye having over 300K active users is the largest Asian crypto community. MiniBridge will help bring BitEye to OP ecosystem with many highlights and marketing resources which will help both sides to grow into the next level. \nMiniBridge address on most blockchains is an EOA: 0x00000000000007736e2F9aA5630B8c812E1F3fc9. Since the birth of MiniBridge (roughly 6 months ago), it has made cumulatively 338,031 bridging transactions on all chains and 28,705 bridging transactions on Optimism and all supported OP stack blockchains. \n\nProject Resource\n\nWebsite: https://minibridge.chaineye.tools/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Chaineye_tools\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/chaineye\n\nGithub: https://github.com/DeFiEye\n\nDocumentation: https://docs.chaineye.tools/\n",

We recently launched our MVP and have gained traction, receiving grants from Base Network and Devfolio. Our team of three is continuously improving the product and user acquisition.\n\nWhat is DeFiLens:\nDeFiLens simplifies decentralized finance (DeFi) trading and portfolio management across multiple blockchain networks. It provides a cross-chain rebalancer tool that helps traders manage, diversify, and optimize their portfolios seamlessly. By abstracting the complexities of network switching, asset bridging, and multiple transactions, DeFiLens offers a unified interface that enhances efficiency, reduces gas fees, and automates strategic rebalancing. This enables users to maximize returns and minimize risks in the rapidly evolving DeFi landscape.\n\nHow It Is Going:\nWe have executed 450 cross-chain batches successfully on 4 EVM chains.

Every OE platform that already exists takes a cut of the proceeds so I'll be building my own!",

    "description": "This project enables MUTATIO ERC1155 NFTs by XCOPY x NeonGlitch86 to be wrapped into an ERC20 token called $FLIES, which allows access to a more efficient way of trading this asset via a DEX.\nMUTATIO is the biggest open edition mint to date and was dropped on Base mid of March 2024 with over 1M pieces minted. ~58% of the supply have already been wrapped into $FLIES and XCOPY has officially acknowledged the project.\nI created this in a solo mission and I'm still the only developer working on it but the project is community run by now.\nWintermute and @seedphrase are among the biggest supporters.\nI'm currently looking into creating an open edition mint platform for artists where all of the proceeds in $FLIES are burned. Every OE platform that already exists takes a cut of the proceeds so I'll be building my own!",

    "description": "Coop Records is an onchain record label.\n\nWe’ve released 268 songs from 70+ artists - driving 200k mints across 70k unique collectors. You can see this data here - https://dune.com/coop_records/coop-recs\n\nWe release ~10 new songs per week and are driving mints to these records using the OP we received from RetroPGF Round 3.\n\nIn total we have distributed ~31.6k OP in incentives across platforms like Boost, Layer3 and Coinvise - driving value back to our artists and our catalog with more than 100 ETH in total earnings.\n\nThis can be tracked by using our address - 0x512b55b00d744fC2eDB8474f223a7498c3e5a7ce to see our stats through Sealaunch - https://dune.com/sealaunch/boost-creator-custom-dashboard\n\nWe set up wallets for these artists, manage all splits and backend payouts, uploads, marketing and onchain distribution across Warpcast and Boost + Layer3. Coop Records is an end-to-end service provider responsible for facilitating the vast majority of mints for our artists.\n\nWe are the biggest power user of Boost and placed first in every week of the Boost Creator Fund over the course of May as seen here: https://dune.com/boost_xyz/boost-creator-fund/b9be8e45-93dc-4ea7-83e4-23d23899e9f7\n\nOutside of releasing music onchain, Coop Records is active as a product builder - having incubated projects like:\n\n- Sonata.tips - a music discovery platform on Farcaster\n- Boombox.fm - a consumer crypto app to share your favorite artists\n- Farconcert - onchain tickets for the Farcon official afterparty\n- Frame Generator - a recurring tool to generate new Frames for every Coop Records releases.\n\nThe main focus being onchain points systems deployed on a Base L3 in partnership with Stack. Our contracts have facilitated more than 150k transactions - largely from users who have never touched crypto before. https://explorer.stack.so/address/0xab18FdC21c33c3C60bbcA753997a657F00d43F9e\n\nWe’re actively growing our onchain subscribers through Coop Records Club - a partnership with Hypersub which gives our community of 250 collectors an airdrop of every release.\nhttps://hypersub.withfabric.xyz/collection/coop-records-club-izh68wci0c8w\n\nCoop Records recently started a new podcast series - which has driven 23k mints across our first 5 episodes. https://pods.media/coop-records\n\nCoop Records also participated as a judge in the We Love the Art competition and helped 25+ artists apply.\n\nAs a record label - it is important for Coop Records to build on top of underlying platforms and protocols. We believe our impact is noticeable and tangible - and wanted to apply for the Onchain Builders round as a more direct way of receiving OP to reinvest into our artists and our community.\n\nWe are in close contact with partners like Sound, Pods, Boost and Layer3 about their Onchain Builder application - but want to vocalize that we have been instrumental in the impact these projects have made on their contracts.\n\nAs a capable dev team - the results of this round will be crucial in our decision to keep building on these shared platforms, versus deciding to build our own. We believe strongly in the network effects of shared contracts, but will not sacrifice our ability to capture value for our artists if it boxes us out of being able to tangibly measure and show the impact we are creating onchain.\n\nWe hope that this description can shine a light on the full scope of the Coop Records ecosystem and look forward to continuing to champion Optimism and Retro Funding in the years to come.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration,\n\nCoop Records Team",

    "description": "Coop Records is an onchain record label.\n\nWe’ve released 268 songs from 70+ artists - driving 200k mints across 70k unique collectors. You can see this data here - https://dune.com/coop_records/coop-recs\n\nWe release ~10 new songs per week and are driving mints to these records using the OP we received from RetroPGF Round 3.\n\nIn total we have distributed ~31.6k OP in incentives across platforms like Boost, Layer3 and Coinvise - driving value back to our artists and our catalog with more than 100 ETH in total earnings.\n\nThis can be tracked by using our address - 0x512b55b00d744fC2eDB8474f223a7498c3e5a7ce to see our stats through Sealaunch - https://dune.com/sealaunch/boost-creator-custom-dashboard\n\nWe set up wallets for these artists, manage all splits and backend payouts, uploads, marketing and onchain distribution across Warpcast and Boost + Layer3. Coop Records is an end-to-end service provider responsible for facilitating the vast majority of mints for our artists.\n\nWe are the biggest power user of Boost and placed first in every week of the Boost Creator Fund over the course of May as seen here: https://dune.com/boost_xyz/boost-creator-fund/b9be8e45-93dc-4ea7-83e4-23d23899e9f7\n\nOutside of releasing music onchain, Coop Records is active as a product builder - having incubated projects like:\n\n- Sonata.tips - a music discovery platform on Farcaster\n- Boombox.fm - a consumer crypto app to share your favorite artists\n- Farconcert - onchain tickets for the Farcon official afterparty\n- Frame Generator - a recurring tool to generate new Frames for every Coop Records releases.\n\nThe main focus being onchain points systems deployed on a Base L3 in partnership with Stack. Our contracts have facilitated more than 150k transactions - largely from users who have never touched crypto before. https://explorer.stack.so/address/0xab18FdC21c33c3C60bbcA753997a657F00d43F9e\n\nWe’re actively growing our onchain subscribers through Coop Records Club - a partnership with Hypersub which gives our community of 250 collectors an airdrop of every release.\nhttps://hypersub.withfabric.xyz/collection/coop-records-club-izh68wci0c8w\n\nCoop Records recently started a new podcast series - which has driven 23k mints across our first 5 episodes. https://pods.media/coop-records\n\nCoop Records also participated as a judge in the We Love the Art competition and helped 25+ artists apply.\n\nAs a record label - it is important for Coop Records to build on top of underlying platforms and protocols. We believe our impact is noticeable and tangible - and wanted to apply for the Onchain Builders round as a more direct way of receiving OP to reinvest into our artists and our community.\n\nWe are in close contact with partners like Sound, Pods, Boost and Layer3 about their Onchain Builder application - but want to vocalize that we have been instrumental in the impact these projects have made on their contracts.\n\nAs a capable dev team - the results of this round will be crucial in our decision to keep building on these shared platforms, versus deciding to build our own. We believe strongly in the network effects of shared contracts, but will not sacrifice our ability to capture value for our artists if it boxes us out of being able to tangibly measure and show the impact we are creating onchain.\n\nWe hope that this description can shine a light on the full scope of the Coop Records ecosystem and look forward to continuing to champion Optimism and Retro Funding in the years to come.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration,\n\nCoop Records Team",

We developed POWERBALD, a free-to-play lottery in a frame where people could claim free tickets and try their luck in the daily drawing. We gave away multiple millions of $DEGEN as jackpot prizes and grew a [community of over 27,000 lottery](https://warpcast.com/lottopgf) enthusiasts. \nWith our PowerBALD lotteries, we raised $1,500 to co-sponsor a Giveth QF round and are currently integrating with [Zuzalu.city](http://zuzalu.city/) to raise funds for their initiatives.\n\nThe PowerBALD Lottery contract was deployed at `0xc94e65A6d6C145B6A0342dA9b5e8Dc3928505857` through our `LooteryFactory` at `0xdED85d9e814c4C23D2632511d3Be9aC4e49524b0`. All relevant contracts are verified on Etherscan and available on our Github.\n\nTo play for free, players had to pass sybil checks like having a $DEGEN tip allowance (see https://www.degen.tips/faq) or owning the (now deprecated) active status on farcaster. After passing the requirements, following @lottopgf and liking the cast, the player would be able to choose their numbers and claim a free ticket every day.\nOur deployer account at `0x77769134B8181e7eb4462D565BF362eC63A4f12d` would then mint the ticket with the chosen numbers for this user via the `ownerPick` method on the contract, resulting in 23,789 transactions minting 32,150 ticket NFTs for nearly 10,000 unique players. In total, we spent well over 2 ETH on gas fees for free claims on Base pre-4844.\n\nWe had to choose the owner transaction variant instead of letting users execute their own transactions as user-initiated transactions were not available in the first version of farcaster frames specs, and additionally executing a transaction free of charge for the user makes for a much more seamless experience.",

    "description": "Minibridge is a \"zero-fee\" cross-chain tool that offers multi-chain support for BTC/EVM/non-EVM and features such as fast transactions. It was developed by the Chaineye team specifically for users' small-amount transfer scenarios. Launched for less than half a year, Minibridge has already processed 300K transactions and served 100K Web3 users. In user ratings on dappsheriff.com, Minibridge ranks first among all cross-chain bridge projects and was awarded \"Best Tool of the Year\" in the \"PARTY AWARD 2024\" annual selection by PA News.\n\nKey Features\n\nChaineye was born from the Web3 community and we build products for the community’s needs. To better serve the community, Chaineye has built many free tools such as Onchain Map, CEX Transfer Fees, Multichain Gas, RPC List, etc. The Mini Bridge was designed specifically for retail investors with small-amount cross-chain transfer requests, including the following features:\n\nZero bridge fees: We don’t charge any bridge fees at all. This means users will get the same amount of assets on the destination chains. We are built for retail investors and we believe our community like free services. Only a minimum gas fee on the destination chain is charged.\n\nFastest transactions: Our bridge has the fastest bridging experience across all existing bridges. The bridging time largely depends on the confirmation time of source and destination blockchains. We don’t want our users to wait any longer than the evitable blockchain transaction time.\n\nDesigned especially for small-amount transfer scenarios such as gas refill, airdrop claiming, moving funds, etc. It helps to save huge money and time for individual investors when doing so.\n\nGas swap: Our community wants to use the destination chain directly after bridging. We get it! The gas swap feature allows users to swap a small amount of source chain ETH to the destination chain native gas token. It is very useful for those chains where ETH is not the native gas token such as BNB Chain, Polygon, ZetaChain, ZkFair, Avalanche, Map, Mantle, and Metis.\n\nFast Integration: Our team is monitoring the market closely and is ready to integrate the latest blockchains in time. Chaineye Mini Bridge currently supports a total of 24 networks including the latest Blast EVM L2 and Merlin BTC L2 blockchain.\n\nOpen API: We have opened the API docs on our documentation site. Any individuals or third parties can go through the API and seamlessly integrate Mini Bridge into their application. Chaineye Mini Bridge works in the same style for both requests from our front-end UI and API endpoints.\n\nSecurity: To prevent the potential security concern of smart contracts, we have implemented our bridge in a hybrid style - a combination of EOA and smart contracts. EOA for cross-chain transfers and smart contracts for cross-chain gas swaps. It helps to reduce the possibility of contract exploitation. In addition, we have our entire system audited and scrutinized by our security partners.\n\nRewards and Earn: Our users can enjoy a big bridge discount by participating in our various marketing campaigns. In addition, they can also earn referral rewards in ETH and $pMNB whenever their referred address makes a transfer. Everything is transparent and Chaineye Mini Bridge is built for the community.\n\nValue Proposition\nMiniBridge extends its liquidity aggregation services to all major OP stacks, including Optimism, Base, Zora, Mode, Fraxtal, and Redstone, enabling community users on all other chains to interact with the OP ecosystem. We are aiming to foster collaboration and engagement between our respective communities, helping OP and Chaineye users to transfer their assets freely across any supported blockchains with the lowest fees and the highest speed. \nMiniBridge was born from the community and built for the community. Our web3 community BitEye having over 300K active users is the largest Asian crypto community. MiniBridge will help bring BitEye to OP ecosystem with many highlights and marketing resources which will help both sides to grow into the next level. \nMiniBridge address on most blockchains is an EOA: 0x00000000000007736e2F9aA5630B8c812E1F3fc9. Since the birth of MiniBridge (roughly 6 months ago), it has made cumulatively 338,031 bridging transactions on all chains and 28,705 bridging transactions on Optimism and all supported OP stack blockchains. \n\nProject Resource\n\nWebsite: https://minibridge.chaineye.tools/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Chaineye_tools\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/chaineye\n\nGithub: https://github.com/DeFiEye\n\nDocumentation: https://docs.chaineye.tools/\n",

Chaineye Mini Bridge works in the same style for both requests from our front-end UI and API endpoints.\n\nSecurity: To prevent the potential security concern of smart contracts, we have implemented our bridge in a hybrid style - a combination of EOA and smart contracts. EOA for cross-chain transfers and smart contracts for cross-chain gas swaps. It helps to reduce the possibility of contract exploitation. In addition, we have our entire system audited and scrutinized by our security partners.\n\nRewards and Earn: Our users can enjoy a big bridge discount by participating in our various marketing campaigns. In addition, they can also earn referral rewards in ETH and $pMNB whenever their referred address makes a transfer. Everything is transparent and Chaineye Mini Bridge is built for the community.\n\nValue Proposition\nMiniBridge extends its liquidity aggregation services to all major OP stacks, including Optimism, Base, Zora, Mode, Fraxtal, and Redstone, enabling community users on all other chains to interact with the OP ecosystem. We are aiming to foster collaboration and engagement between our respective communities, helping OP and Chaineye users to transfer their assets freely across any supported blockchains with the lowest fees and the highest speed. \nMiniBridge was born from the community and built for the community. Our web3 community BitEye having over 300K active users is the largest Asian crypto community. MiniBridge will help bring BitEye to OP ecosystem with many highlights and marketing resources which will help both sides to grow into the next level. \nMiniBridge address on most blockchains is an EOA: 0x00000000000007736e2F9aA5630B8c812E1F3fc9. Since the birth of MiniBridge (roughly 6 months ago), it has made cumulatively 338,031 bridging transactions on all chains and 28,705 bridging transactions on Optimism and all supported OP stack blockchains. \n\nProject Resource\n\nWebsite: https://minibridge.chaineye.tools/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Chaineye_tools\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/chaineye\n\nGithub: https://github.com/DeFiEye\n\nDocumentation: https://docs.chaineye.tools/\n",

I have been contributing to the web3 space for the last four years, previously serving as a core team member at InfinityPools as a Solidity Engineer and as the CTO at Chill Finance. DeFiLens is a chain abstraction DApp, Which I started to increase user engagement in the DeFi space by simplifying DeFi across chains. We recently launched our MVP and have gained traction, receiving grants from Base Network and Devfolio. Our team of three is continuously improving the product and user acquisition.\n\nWhat is DeFiLens:\nDeFiLens simplifies decentralized finance (DeFi) trading and portfolio management across multiple blockchain networks. It provides a cross-chain rebalancer tool that helps traders manage, diversify, and optimize their portfolios seamlessly. By abstracting the complexities of network switching, asset bridging, and multiple transactions, DeFiLens offers a unified interface that enhances efficiency, reduces gas fees, and automates strategic rebalancing. This enables users to maximize returns and minimize risks in the rapidly evolving DeFi landscape.\n\nHow It Is Going:\nWe have executed 450 cross-chain batches successfully on 4 EVM chains. Each batch contains around 25 transactions, which we simplified into one transaction with a single click. We built DeFiLens frames on Warpcast, garnering around 2,000 views and 200 users trying out our DeFi frames.",

By integrating $blue into various products and services, we ensure continuous value addition to the ecosystem, promoting long-term growth.\n\nWe aim to develop a range of practical and engaging products that use $blue as both a payment option and a value accumulator. This will create a sustainable economy for $blue holders and continuously add value to the ecosystem.\n\n$blue is the first-ever metameme, blending memes, art, and culture into a single, vibrant movement. It unifies all blue-themed meme coins into a unique digital experience, representing innovation in the web3 realm and challenging the traditional meme economy.\n\nBy leveraging $blue, we will create an ecosystem where users can easily integrate $blue into their digital activities. \n\nOur diverse product range will enhance the utility of $blue, strengthen its role in digital culture, and support a growing and engaged community.\n\nEcosystem Product Vision\n\n1. Yield Farming (readiness 95%)\n\nIntroduce yield farming opportunities where users can stake their $blue tokens in liquidity pools to earn additional rewards.\n\n2. PvP Games (in progress)\n\nDevelop Telegram miniapps and standalone games that enable users to engage in player-versus-player (PvP) games, using $blue tokens for in-game transactions and rewards.\n\n3. TG Mini Apps (in progress)\n\nDevelop “The Blue Meme Coin Challenge” - an engaging idle game within Telegram where players create and manage meme coin projects. \n\nTelegram mini apps are the perfect tool to attract a huge audience and create an effective funnel for user acquisition. \n\nBy offering interactive and gamified experiences, our mini app will captivate users, keeping them engaged and active within the $blue ecosystem. \n\n4. $blue integrations with other projects (in progress)\n\nEnable payments and transactions within partner apps using $blue tokens, making them a practical and functional part of users' daily routines.\n\nThis not only boosts the utility and demand for $blue but also reinforces its role as a versatile and valuable digital currency within the broader ecosystem.\n\n5.
